Requires [cassandra docker installation](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/quickstart.html).   
Note for linux: Installation of `Docker engine` may not be sufficient to run the script. Make sure to install the full `Docker Desktop` instead.

First make it executable: `chmod +x cassandraWrapper.py`   
Then run it: `./cassandraWrapper.py`
